- **Smart Contract Automation**: The rental process, including payments and contract enforcement, is managed by smart contracts, ensuring security and reducing the need for intermediaries.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A seamless interface for users to search for available cars, select rental dates, and complete transactions.
